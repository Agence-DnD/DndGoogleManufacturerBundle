# Google Manufacturer Connector:

Google Manufacturer Connector allows you to export your products from Akeneo PIM into XML format for Google Manufacturer.

It will create a new "Google Manufacturer - XML Products Export" export type in which you can map your Akeneo PIM  attributes to the mandatory attributes needed for Google Manufacturer exports. The connector will generate a XML file with the correct structure for Google Manufacturer integration.
